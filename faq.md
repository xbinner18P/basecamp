# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where should I report a bug?

We are actively fixing feature-related bugs for Basecamp 3 and HEY.

* If you find a bug in Basecamp 3, please add a new todo to the Awaiting Triage to-do list in [BC3: Bugs](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/564667/todosets/80120962). It’s a good idea to try to do a quick search first to see if your bug has already been reported, but better to report something twice than not at all.

* If you find a bug related to HEY, add to the Triage to-do list in [HEY: The Issues (Bugs)](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/17269660/todolists/2705482276). Tag in Michael so that he can check if this is already reported or a new case. There are a few exceptions for spam and content processing related bugs (review [this internal writeup](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/17308762/messages/2801019566) for more instructions).

We do fix any security or privacy related bugs for all products, including our legacy products. If you think you’ve found one, flag to SIP by mentioning them in the relevant HelpScout case (if applicable) or raising in their Campfire.
