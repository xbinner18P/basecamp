# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where should I report a bug?

Basecamp 3 is currently the only product that we’re actively fixing functionality bugs on. If you find a bug in Basecamp 3, please add a new todo to the Awaiting Triage todolist in [BC3: Bugs](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/564667/todosets/80120962). It’s a good idea to try to do a quick search first to see if your bug has already been reported, but better to report something twice than not at all.
